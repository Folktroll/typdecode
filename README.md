## Project Scope & Disclaimer

### What this project is **NOT**:
- It is **not** intended to replace existing GUI tools for working with `.typ` files.
- It does **not** aim to be a fully featured, production-ready solution.

### Warnings:
- This is my **first GitHub project**.
- This is my **first Python project**.
- I do **not** understand the Czech language - parts of the original Perl script are in Czech, so interpretation may be imperfect.
- 100% compatibility with the `.typ` **text** (`.txt`) format is **not** a priority.

### Main Goal:
- Provide a simple CLI-based tool capable of **decompiling `.typ` files** without relying on any GUI.

### Contributions:
Pull requests, issues, and comments are **highly welcome** and strongly encouraged.
